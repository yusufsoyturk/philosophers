Dining Philosophers problem implemented in C using threads and mutexes – a classic concurrency exercise from 42 School.
🧠 Dining Philosophers – 42 Project
This project is a solution to the classic Dining Philosophers Problem, a concurrency challenge designed to explore thread synchronization and resource management. Developed as part of the curriculum at 42 School, it simulates a scenario where philosophers alternately think, eat, and sleep – without causing deadlock or starvation.

🛠️ Technologies
Language: C

Concurrency: pthreads (mutexes & threads)

Environment: Unix/Linux

📌 Project Goals
Understand and manage race conditions

Prevent deadlocks, starvation, and data corruption

Use mutexes effectively to control shared resources (forks)
